# Brandon Montez â€“ Undergraduate Porfolio

This is a portfolio of some of the projects I completed during my undergraduate studies as a Data Theory major.

In order to respect UCLA's honor code, many works are omitted. This selection is meant to give an idea of some of problems that I have tackled, as well as my coding style.
