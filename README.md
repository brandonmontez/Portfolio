# Brandon Montez â€“ Undergraduate Porfolio

This is a portfolio of some of the projects I completed during my undergraduate studies as a Data Theory major.

To respect UCLA's honor code, this collection is not meant to be comprehensive, but it should give an idea of some of problems that I have tackled, as well as my coding style.
